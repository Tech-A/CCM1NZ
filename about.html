  <div class="mySlides">
    <q><i>The service was very professional and straightforward. Conrad would provide me with a checklist of all the
      needed documents and he would just update me if he needed some supplementary documents and requirements. He
      would also suggest an option in case the process does not work.
      The overall experience was great and fulfilling considering my husband having past medical conditions and he was
      able to pull through and had our residency visa approved!</i></q>
