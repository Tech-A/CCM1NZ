      <q><i>The service was very professional and straightforward. Conrad would provide me with a checklist of all the
          needed documents and he would just update me if he needed some supplementary documents and requirements. He
          would also suggest an option in case the process does not work.
          The overall experience was great and fulfilling considering my husband having past medical conditions and he
          was
          able to pull through and had our residency visa approved!</i></q>

          his expertise to handle difficult applications and our case is a little bit complicated but he explained it
          very
          clearly to the Immigration Officer. We got our Residence Visa because of him. He is accommodating and most
          importantly he doesn't charge very high.</i></q>
