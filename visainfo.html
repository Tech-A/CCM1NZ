   <!-- GENERAL SECTION -->
  <div class="ccontainer">
    <!-- <h3 class = "w3-h3">Operation history</h3> -->
    <p class="w3-p">New Zealand is a beautiful and diverse country located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, east of
      Australia. It is known for its stunning natural landscapes, outdoor adventures, and friendly people. If you are
      considering immigrating to New Zealand, you will find a range of information on this page to help you get started.
    </p>
  </div>




     <!-- VISA SECTION -->
  <div class="visa-container">
    <h2 class="w3-h2">Visa options:</h2>
    <p class="w3-p">If you are considering moving to New Zealand, there are a few different options available to you
      depending on your situation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work Visa: If you have a job offer from a New Zealand employer, you may be eligible for a work visa. This will
        allow you to live and work in New Zealand for a specific period of time.</li>
      <li>Student Visa: If you are planning on studying in New Zealand, you will need to apply for a student visa. This
        will allow you to study at a New Zealand educational institution for the duration of your course.</li>
      <li>Visitor Visa: If you are planning on visiting New Zealand for a short period of time, you may be eligible for
        a visitor visa. This will allow you to stay in the country for up to nine months.</li>
      <li>Resident Visa: If you are planning on making New Zealand your permanent home, you may be eligible for a
        resident visa. This will allow you to live, work, and study in New Zealand indefinitely.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>




   <!-- VISA-APPLY SECTION -->
  <div class="apply-container">
    <h2>Applying for a visa:</h2>
    <p class="w3-p">To apply for a visa to immigrate to New Zealand, you will need to complete an online application
      form and provide various documents, such as your passport, birth certificate, and police clearance certificate.
      You may also need to pay an application fee.</p>
    <p class="w3-p">After you have submitted your application, it will be reviewed by immigration officials, who will
      decide whether to grant you a visa. The process can take several months, so it is important to start your
      application as early as possible.</p>
  </div>



  <!-- VISA-LIVING SECTION -->
  <div class="living-container">
    <h2>Living in New Zealand:</h2>
    <p class="w3-p">If you are granted a visa and decide to immigrate to New Zealand, there are a few things you should
      know about living in the country. New Zealand has a high standard of living and a strong economy, with
      opportunities for work and education. The country is also known for its natural beauty and outdoor lifestyle, with
      plenty of opportunities for hiking, biking, and other outdoor activities.</p>
    <p class="w3-p">It is also important to note that New Zealand has strict laws and regulations, and it is important
      to follow them to avoid any legal issues. You should also make sure to get medical insurance, as the cost of
      healthcare in New Zealand can be high.</p>
    <p class="w3-p">We hope this information has been helpful and has given you a good overview of the immigration
      process to New Zealand. If you have any further questions or need more specific information, you can contact the
      Immigration New Zealand for more information.</p>

      <q><i>The service was very professional and straightforward. Conrad would provide me with a checklist of all the
          needed documents and he would just update me if he needed some supplementary documents and requirements. He
          would also suggest an option in case the process does not work.
          The overall experience was great and fulfilling considering my husband having past medical conditions and he
          was
          able to pull through and had our residency visa approved!</i></q>
